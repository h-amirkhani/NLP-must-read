### Annotation-Artifacts (2018)
- [Annotation Artifacts in Natural Language Inference Data](http://aclweb.org/anthology/N18-2017) . Suchin Gururangan, Swabha Swayamdipta, Omer Levy, Roy Schwartz, Samuel R. Bowman, Noah A. Smith .  NAACL-HLT, 2018.
- It shows that because of the heuristics used by annotators, large-scale datasets for natural language inference contain clues which are exploited by the learning algorithms, resulting in the models which “game” the task by learning to detect annotation artifacts instead of learning to inference.
